## Randamazon

### Description
Randamazon is an application that buys random things from Amazon. Buyers will
not know what they bought until the package arrives to their homes.

## Operation
1. Choose a budget.
2. Select either an Amazon wish list or an Amazon department to buy from.
3. Click Go.

Randamazon will buy things from the wish list or an entire Amazon department
until the budget is met. In the case of a wish list, it will only buy things
if it can afford it.
